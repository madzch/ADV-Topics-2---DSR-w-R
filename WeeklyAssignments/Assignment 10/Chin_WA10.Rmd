# Introduction

Comparing proportions is sometimes very hard! But, even infants seem to be able to do it a little bit. The purpose of this science project was to better understand how well people compare proportions when the proportions are presented in different formats. The purpose of this class assignment is to take the R-code and plots we've been generating over the last several weeks and put it all together into one poster format.  

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

# Research Objectives

1. Does average performance vary across format type?
2. Does average performance vary across numerator congruency status?
3. Does numerator congruency vary across format type?(ie., is there an interaction)

# Participants
```{r amt_participants}
numpart <- 99
```

A total of `r numpart` adults participated in the study.

# Methods
First participants were introduced to a story about a magic ball and that the outcome(ie., blue or orange) depended on the proportions. They were then asked to compare the proportions of different images. 

In other words, participants were shown two images of the same kind at the same time and asked to decided which had a higher proportion of the shape (or dots) colored in blue. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images_WA10/Probtask_Trial.png")
```
Conditions
There were four different conditions that changed what kinds of images the participants saw: 

- divided blobs: blur ad orange were entirely separate
- integrated blob: one blob, divided to be part blue and part orange
- separated dots: blue and orange dots were on opposite sides of the image
- integrated dots: blue and orange dots were intermixed. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images_WA10/Probtask_formats.png")

```


# Results

1. Does average performance vary across format type, ignoring all other aspects of the stimuli?


```{r dblcheck_prob_task, include = FALSE}
#Double checking summary is correct/Summarizing to get the proportion of the data correct. 
prob_data_summary <- prob_task%>%
  group_by(SubID, condition) %>%
  summarise(prop_corr = mean(correct), .groups = 'drop')  # Ensure ungrouping
print(prob_data_summary)
```

```{r recalcprop_corr, include = FALSE}
# Calculate mean proportion correct for each condition
mean_prop_summary <- prob_data_summary%>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(mean_prop_corr = mean(prop_corr),
            sd_prop_corr = sd(prop_corr), prop_corr,  # Standard deviation for error bars(to help with readability of the plot)
            n = n(), .groups = 'drop')

```

```{r returnplot}
mean_prop_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = prop_corr )) +
  ggdist::stat_slab() +  # Adds a distributional layer to show the density of the data
  geom_point(aes(x = condition, y = mean_prop_corr), 
             color = "blue", position = position_nudge(y = 0.05)) +  # Offset mean points for clarity
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Accuracy by Condition",
       x = "Format Type", y = "Accuracy") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Improved readability


```
*Yes, the blue dots in the above plot prove that the average performance varies across formatting types.*

2. How are reaction time and accuracy related?

```{r prepprobtask, include = FALSE}
average_data <- prob_task %>%
  group_by(SubID, condition) %>%
  summarize(rt = mean(rt), correct = mean(correct), .groups = 'drop')


```


```{r timevsacc}
# Plot with facet by condition
ggplot(average_data, aes(x = rt, y = correct)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap((~ condition), scales = 'free_y') +
  labs(
    title = "Reaction Time vs. Accuracy (Facets by Condition)",
    x = "Average Reaction Time (ms)",
    y = "Accuracy"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
*As time increases along the x axis, so does the accuracy for each of the format types, until the time reaches about 1250 milliseconds*


3. How does numerator congruency interact with format type

```{r, numcongcalc, include = FALSE}
prob_data_mod <- prob_task%>%
  # a. Separate `left_stim` and `right_stim` based on `_` separator
  separate(left_stim, into = c("left_numerator", "left_other"), sep = "_", fill = "right") %>%
  separate(right_stim, into = c("right_numerator", "right_other"), sep = "_", fill = "right") %>%
  
  # Convert columns to numeric
  mutate(
    left_numerator = as.numeric(left_numerator),
    left_other = as.numeric(left_other),
    right_numerator = as.numeric(right_numerator),
    right_other = as.numeric(right_other)
    
  ) %>%
  
  # c. Create `left_proportion_value` and `right_proportion_value`
  mutate(
    left_proportion_value = left_numerator / (left_numerator + left_other),
    right_proportion_value = right_numerator / (right_numerator + right_other),
  # d. Create `larger_numerator`
    larger_numerator = if_else(left_numerator > right_numerator, "left", "right"),
  # e. Create `larger_proportion`
    larger_proportion = if_else(left_proportion_value > right_proportion_value, "left", "right"),
  # f. Create `num_congruent`
    num_congruent = larger_numerator == larger_proportion
  )
```
```{r numerplot, include=TRUE}
# Summarize data for plotting
plot_mod <- prob_data_mod %>%
  group_by(SubID,condition, num_congruent) %>%
  summarize(proportion_correct = mean(correct), .groups = 'drop')
#stat_halfeye still not working even though ggplot is in setup chunk

# Create the plot using `stat_halfeye`
ggplot(plot_mod, aes(x = condition, y = proportion_correct, color = num_congruent)) +
  stat_halfeye() +
  labs(
    x = "Format Type",
    y = "Accuracy",
    color = "Numerator Congruency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```
*Numerator Congruency is only marked TRUE for Accuracy rates above about .60 according to the graph. The largest range of TRUE numerator congruency is in blob_stacked format type than any other formatting.*
