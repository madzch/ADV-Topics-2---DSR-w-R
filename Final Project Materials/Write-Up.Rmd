# Information for Initial Ioslide

## Big Question 

How does PTSD influence the way individuals perceive and segment everyday activities into meaningful events?

### Little Question 
Does PTSD symptom severity, particularly hypervigilance (arousal), affect individuals' ability to segment coarse-grained and fine-grained events while watching neutral, everyday activities in a movie? #

```{r personal_notes}
#leave out arousal for the official presentation/project assignment project, mostly bc its weird.
```





##Background Info 

```{r secondslide}
#Where did the dataset come from.  
```
